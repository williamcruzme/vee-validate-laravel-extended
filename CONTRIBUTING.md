### Folder Structure

As you can see we have:

### Issues

When creating issues, please provide as much details as possible. A clear explanation on the issue and a reliable production example can help us greatly in improving this project. Your issue may get closed if it cannot be easily reproduced so please provide a working example using either [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) or [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/). Your example should only focus on the issue, minimal and clearly produces the issue.

If your issue gets closed for not providing enough info or not responding to the maintainers' comments, do not consider it a hostile action. There are probably other issues that the maintainers are working on and must give priority to issues that are well investigated, you can always revisit the issue and address the reasons that it was closed and we will be happy to re-open it and address it properly. Sometimes a commit will close your issue without a response from the maintainers so make sure you read the issue timeline to prevent any misunderstandings.

### Code Style
